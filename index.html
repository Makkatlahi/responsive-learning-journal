          Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.

        <h2 class="home-article__title">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p class="home-article__text">
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
        </p>
        <p class="home-article__text">
          While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
          was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
        </p>

        <h2 class="home-article__title">How I got started</h2>
        <p class="home-article__text">
          I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
          take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
          use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
          short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
        </p>
        <p class="home-article__text">
          That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
          my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
          motivated.
